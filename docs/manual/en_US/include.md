# Include files

The simplest way to use bfdev only requires one header file:

```c
#include <bfdev.h>
```

This file contains all modules. If you do not want to import so many files, you should directly reference the module header file.

Linked list should include

```c
#include <bfdev/list.h>
```

RB-tree should include

```c
#include <bfdev/rbtree.h>
```
