# Installing bfdev

bfdev can be installed differently, depending on the operating system.

## Installation on Archlinux

For Archlinux, bfdev can be installed from [packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bfdev-git) through aur.

## Installation on Docker

For Docker, bfdev [packages](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/opbfdev/bfdev) from hub.docker.com can be used.

## Building from Sources

If some special functionality is required, not available with packages and ports, bfdev can also be compiled from source files. While more flexible, this approach may be complex for a beginner. For more information, see [Building bfdev from Sources](configure.md).
